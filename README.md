# Visualisation Design

This README file aims to explain and evaluate the visualisations created on the Dash app with respect to the target
audience and the questions that were answered using the visualisations.

## Target Audience

![Target Audience](multi_page_app/assets/images/Target_Audience.png)
The target audience for this web app can be shown in the persona above. Our target audience is generally a middle-aged
male who is married and has 2 children. He has just started his own business after working in a large corporate firm for
a long time and has worked hard to gain the status and money that he has earned. Right now, his business is growing, and
he is employing more employees in his company and while doing so trying to find a suitable area to set up an office.
With this webapp, he should be able to find a suitable area to start up his business and sustain after many years there.

On a day-to-day basis, the persona uses a laptop and smartphone regularly and uses apps like Facebook, Waze, Zoopla,
Youtube and Twitter. For this app to be successful, the persona feels that the app should have an easy-to-use UI,
informative data and it must be interactive so that it gauges his attention.
